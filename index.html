      <div class="poem-container">
        <p>I adore how I first saw you on Reddit</p>
        <p>
          There was a post where everyone was sharing their darkest jokes, and
          you were like
        </p>
        <p>“What is a hill of cats called?” “A Meowtain!”</p>
        <p>
          I adore how you replied to my lame puns which I dmed you with even
          more lame puns
        </p>
        <p>I adore how we instantly connected after that</p>
        <p>
          I adore how we used to talk whole night (“Ik you’re obsessed with me,
          but sona nai hai?”)
        </p>
        <p>I adore how you used to wise me “Morning” everyday</p>
        <p>
          I adore all the *duck* pics and the *pussy* pics you send me (they’re
          as cute as you)
        </p>
        <p>I adore your sweet pickup lines and dirty puns</p>
        <p>Vg means “Very Good”. And NOT VAGINA!</p>
        <p>I adore your every use of the line “That’s what she said”</p>
        <p>
          I adore your unnecessary use of vowels in random words – “Okie”
          “Tello”
        </p>
        <p>I adore HOW DIFFERENT YOUR NAME IS</p>
        <p>
          I adore how previously your idea of giving gaali was “Gadhe ke bache”
        </p>
        <p>I still adore the first voice note you sent me - “Chutiye ho kya”</p>
        <p>
          And I adore your each and every voice note – you moaning all of a
          sudden, you singing like a little child, or you laughing like a
          cartoon character (please start sending them again on immediate basis)
        </p>
        <p>
          I adore how you start spamming item song lyrics on chat out of the
          blue
        </p>
        <p>
          I adore your music taste (fun fact – I wanna be yours made it to my
          Spotify wrapped last year)
        </p>
        <p>
          I adore how you gaslight me every time (yes you do, and you are very
          good at it)
        </p>
        <p>
          I adore the fact that I am one of the only few guys you talk to on a
          daily basis (that is, if it’s still true)
        </p>
        <p>
          I adore those dumb af games we used to play – Stumble Guys, Ludo (you
          are right that you are a pro, I lost every single time) and Skribble
          (even after drawing so well you use to lose lol)
        </p>
        <p>
          I adore the first movie we watched together – Bahubully (I was so
          nervous that you would not like it or get bored af)
        </p>
        <p>
          I adore how we used to laugh our hearts out while watching comedy
          videos together (tanmay bhatt, standup specials, comedy premier
          league)
        </p>
        <p>I adore your every pfp (and hate it when you remove it)</p>
        <p>
          I adore your dressing sense (but papa ke jutey pehenke raste ke bich
          khade hokar lipstick lagana is not aesthetic)
        </p>
        <p>I adore how you share everything with me</p>
        <p>I adore how you listen to everything I share you</p>
        <p>
          I adore how you behave like a 5 yo one second and like a totally
          different matured person the other second
        </p>
        <p>
          I adore how brave you are to live in Delhi, all by yourself (honestly,
          I could never. I have watched a lot of crime patrol)
        </p>
        <p>
          I adore how you do your every chore by yourself (I have huge respect
          for you. Like, mujse to apni bedsheet tak nai badly jaati)
        </p>
        <p>
          I adore the bond we have even though we have never met (it’s better
          than most of the irl friendships)
        </p>
        <p>I adore you as a friend, I adore you as a person</p>
        <p>So, a very Happy Birthday to the most adorable girl in my life</p>
        <p>A very Happy Birthday to you, Dobi.</p>
